# The concrete of abstraction

Basically two things I want to do with this

##Add more words to the lists

There's a list of concrete nouns that tend to work best if you can imagine them being a shitty diagram. But don't let that stifle your creativity. Then there's a list of abstract nouns that should be as airy fairy as possible. The longer the lists the better.

##Automatically generate an image to go with the text

This could do something like search Google images with the generated noun + 'diagram' or something like that. No idea if this is possible. Also should make the image black and white (because design).
